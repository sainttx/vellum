"Champagne at beer prices:
 Back to the future with Linux and Opensource"
 Evan Summers, 16 June 2001


ABSTRACT

Using thin-client Linux technology and opensource software,
schools are now able to create world-class computer facilities for
a fraction of the cost. For starters, opensource software does not
require license fees, and includes the robust Linux multi-user
operating system, the state-of-the-art KDE graphical desktop, and
other powerful applications such as StarOffice and the Forte Java
programming environment from Sun Microsystems. But what is really
interesting is that we need only low-spec diskless PCs
functioning as graphical terminals to access such applications on
a Linux server; and these days a powerful Pentium server with
512Mb RAM costs much the same as a Windows workstation.

Even a 486 with 16Mb is sufficient for the function of a graphical
"X terminal", since all users' applications run on the server.
This provides schools with the opportunity to make effective use
of existing low-spec computers, and inexpensive refurbished PCs
which companies are willing to donate because they are not
upgradable to the minimum 64Mb of RAM required to run the latest
Windows systems.

Using recycled computers as low-cost diskless terminals enables
schools to deploy terminals in staff rooms and classrooms,
to facilitate the effective use of ICTs by educators.

Linux infrastructure and opensource software provides the highest
quality learning environment from an IT vocational perspective.
What is exciting is that this higher quality can be achieved at
a lower cost than the purely end-user oriented software environment.

This means that for the first time since the advent of computers
in education, universal access is truely achievable since
diskless Linux technology and opensource software can provide
high-quality computer education facilities at a small fraction
of the cost previously possible - "Champagne at beer prices" :)
