This series was published on my [blog](http://weblogs.java.net/evanx) some years ago, but and is <tt>rehashed</tt> here on this wiki, to be rehashed in an upcoming series to be called "Venigma."

The first new article in that series will be "Password Salt" not least because this dated "Password Hash" article is dangerously deficient of salt.

[Password Hash](PasswordHash.md) (February 2007)

[Cryptonomical](Cryptonomical.md) (March 2007)

[Encryptic](Encryptic.md) (April 2007)
