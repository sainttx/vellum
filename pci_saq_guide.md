## Vulnerabilities ##

Post-mortem compromise analysis has shown common security weaknesses that are addressed by PCI
DSS, but were not in place in the organizations when the compromises occurred. PCI DSS was designed
and includes detailed requirements for exactly this reasonâ€”to minimize the chance of compromise and
the effects if a compromise does occur.

Investigations after compromises consistently show common PCI DSS violations, including but not limited
to:

  * Storage of magnetic stripe data (Requirement 3.2). It is important to note that many compromised entities are unaware that their systems are storing this data.

  * Inadequate access controls due to improperly installed merchant POS systems, allowing malicious users in via paths intended for POS vendors (Requirements 7.1, 7.2, 8.2 and 8.3)

  * Default system settings and passwords not changed when system was set up (Requirement 2.1)

  * Unnecessary and insecure services not removed or secured when system was set up (Requirements 2.2.2 and 2.2.4)

  * Poorly coded web applications resulting in SQL injection and other vulnerabilities, which allow access to the database storing cardholder data directly from the web site (Requirement 6.5)

  * Missing and outdated security patches (Requirement 6.1)

  * Lack of logging (Requirement 10)

  * Lack of monitoring (via log reviews, intrusion detection/prevention, quarterly vulnerability scans, and file integrity monitoring systems) (Requirements 10.6, 11.2, 11.4 and 11.5)

  * Poorly implemented network segmentation resulting in the cardholder data environment being unknowingly exposed to weaknesses in other parts of the network that have not been secured according to PCI DSS (for example, from unsecured wireless access points and vulnerabilities introduced via employee e-mail and web browsing) (Requirements 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4)
